hello all. sorry for the untimely reply, this project hasn't been of much interest to me for quite some time, and i've completely lost the development environment i was using. i've since realised a couple of things..
A) this repo is the first result on google when searching "wot offline server" and,
B) this is not all my code. afaik it was made by a fellow named "izeberg" (or something similar) who has, since, removed almost all of his projects publicly.

with that being said, I'm not even sure what version of WoT this is for. it surely isn't the most current version. I could try updating it, as it seems a few people are interested in it. give me a week or so I'll see what I can do if you're still around.

for now, all you need to do is make sure you have python 2.7 installed and run the build scripts. it should produce a .wotmod file for you to stick in ur mods folder. though im certain i tried it and it won't load. it also requires an api mod of sorts. will update here with more details when they become available.

+1, I'm interested in developing this project, so if it is possible to create a guide or someting else that would be nice @typicalMoves
clone the project. if you have python knowledge, please let me know.

Hi @hi-skittles
I managed to compile both observer and hangar mods.
When I connect to wargaming, i'm put to hangar but can't select tank nor perform basic tasks.
Everywhere there are messages saying that the connection to the server couldn't be established.
Any ideas?

Hi!
May I ask you to update the code to the latest version of the game?

no it will be fine. do not try most recent version. you need some dependency mods as well. i will upload them here soon. i recently almost lost all the data related to this project because i had my motherboard in my old PC fail and corrupt my windows kernel etc etc. anyways, its not gone, so i will try to upload some stuff. if you want to develop this project further, please do so by forking my code and creating a pull request with your changes. if it looks good, i'll merge it.

i likely won't do this. there is not much reason unfortunately for me to do so as i haven't played this game in well over 2 years. i completed the game in my opinion and ever since 2016 its gone downhill. 11+ years with a single game does somethin to ya. anyways, maybe once i brush up on my python skills and WG adds a dev api i think it would be possible :)

you will need this file to run the mod, else you will have many errors or it may not work at all. poliroid removed all of his code for older versions, so the fact i was able to compile this mod into a usuable .wotmod is nothing short of a godsend.

Would you be interested in resuming the work for compensation or sponsorship?
